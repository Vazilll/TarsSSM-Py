# TARS 2026+ Strategic Roadmap: The Path to Cognitive Sovereignty

This document outlines the evolutionary path of the TARS system from its current SSM-v2.3 baseline to the "TARS 3.0" breakthrough architecture.

## Phase 1: Semantic Precision (Months 1-3)
**Focus**: Grounding the convergence theory in Information Geometry.
- **Information Auditor**: Switching from Euclid to Fisher. Measuring "Thought" as a flow of information distance (KL-Divergence).
- **Bayesian Confidence**: Integrating INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) for real-time posterior estimation of the convergence parameter $p$.
- **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)**: Implementing AdaNODEs-style drift detection to reset thoughts when incoming sensor distributions shift.

## Phase 2: Guaranteed Dynamics (Months 4-9)
**Focus**: Structural evolution toward finite-time convergence.
- **Zhang State Engines**: Implementing ZNN-based update rules with Li activation functions to guarantee a mathematical upper bound on "thinking time" ($T_{max}$).
- **Ordered Matrix Kernels**: Moving to Ordered Matrix Dirichlet (OMD) distributions for SSM weights to ensure monotonic semantic dominance in state transitions.
- **Spectral Audit**: Implementing SVD of the Hankel matrix for the thought-process history to detect "rank collapse" (thought redundancy).

## Phase 3: Hardware & Determinism (Years 1-3)
**Focus**: Edge-deployment and reliability.
- **Rational Arithmetic Core**: Transitioning the entire compute path to Rational Arithmetic (Numerator/Denominator pairs) with deferred division. Eliminating floating-point non-determinism.
- **Analog Auditor Prototyping**: Designing an analog SRAM-in-memory compute chip for the `Integral Auditor` to reach 5000x energy efficiency.
- **Matrix Flows (Continuous Time)**: Moving from discrete step recursion to True Continuous Time Neural Networks (CTNN) where "Step 1, 2, 3" becomes a continuous integral.

## Phase 4: Full Multi-Modal Autonomy (Years 3-5)
**Focus**: The TARS "Agent Communication Protocol" (ACP) and total agency.
- **Hemispheric Glue (Laten Integration)**: Direct cross-modal latent injection (Vision → Brain → Speech) without tokenization bottlenecks.
- **Meta-Auditor (Dynamic p)**: Automatic calibration of the $p$ threshold based on task complexity (e.g., $p=1.2$ for Math, $p=1.05$ for Chat).
- **Integrated Vision-Language Integral**: Validating convergence across visual and textual streams simultaneously (Cross-Modal Convergence).
- **MCP Native Integration**: TARS as a primary node in the Model Context Protocol network.

## 📈 Performance Targets (TARS 3.0)
| Metric | Baseline (v2.3) | Target (v3.0) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **Mean Latency** | 450ms | **< 100ms** |
| **Energy Efficiency** | High | **5000x Improvement** (In-Memory) |
| **Bayesian Calibration** | N/A | **ECE < 0.05** |
| **Peak RAM** | 2.5 GB | **< 800 MB** (BitNet 1.58-bit) |
| **Reasoning Depth** | 8 steps | **Adaptive (IA Driven)** |

## 🔗 Scientific Publication Objectives
1. **Convergence Foundation**: "Improper Integral Convergence for Recursive AI" (Chikulaev & Kadymov).
2. **RRN Excellence**: "Hybrid Relational-Recursive Cores for Low-Parameter Reasoning".
3. **Hardware Revolution**: "1.58-bit Integral Dynamics on Analog SRAM".
